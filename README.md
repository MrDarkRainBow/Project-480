# Project-480
This is a personal project of recreating the pen hardware for the wacom CTH-480 pen tablet.

It contains board scans from a broken donated pen and digital recreations of the pcb (extreamly rough for now). I plan on expanding this in the future as I spend more time on this.

If you have any information that you think might be helpful, or just want to help (currently obtaining photoscans of non broken boards is my main priority), feel free to contact me on discord: Mr_DarkRainBow#5602
